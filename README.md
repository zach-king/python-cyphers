# python-cyphers
For use with "Hacking Secret Cyphers with Python" by Al Sweigart book. All code
credit goes to him. Al also has some other really great books such as "Invent
With Python" and I highly recommend his works, as they are very helpful for
beginner and intermmediate programmers alike. 

Once, again, I attribute this repository's contents to Al Sweigart, and take no
responsibility for further sharing and/or attribution.
